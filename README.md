# RenPy-DigiLet_pi
VN from a python-based digital letter I created some years ago

# Stumbled upon Ren'Py (https://www.renpy.org/)
A digital letter was my very first python project a few years back.
I was trying to create it using Kivy (https://kivy.org/) but was not able to do so for I have to code everything by myself using that framework and I was just a newbie (sill am, I think).
Then upon exploring apps/snaps using Zorin OS (https://zorin.com/os/), I found this Ren'Py thing and found that it is exactly what I was looking for to complete this digital letter project fo mine...
So, I studied it. ;P

This repo is actually not for public consumption as everything on the letter is personal but I want the world to (somehow) know that I was coding for this so,...whatever!
Cheers! Hope I can finish and send this to that special someone as soon as possible.
